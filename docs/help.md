# tc Help Contract

The supported operational forms are:

```text
tc [OPTIONS] [--] <PATH>...
tc [OPTIONS] --dry-run [--] <PATH>...
```

`--` permits a Trash Input whose path begins with a hyphen. A successful preview writes the complete
top-level Trash Plan to stdout in input order. Each line contains the entry kind and a quoted path;
control characters are escaped so paths containing newlines remain unambiguous. Dry-run mode never
moves, deletes, overwrites, or sends an item to Trash.

Moving an item to Trash does not immediately free disk space. Finder controls recovery, and Put Back
is not guaranteed for every volume or failure. tc never permanently deletes an item or empties Trash.

Smart confirmation proceeds without a prompt for one ordinary file or link and asks once for
multiple top-level inputs or any directory. `never` proceeds without prompting, `once` asks once for
the complete top-level summary, and `each` asks before each input. `-I` asks once when more than three
top-level inputs are supplied or a planned input is a directory. Confirmation summaries count only
top-level inputs and directories and never inspect directory contents or calculate sizes.

Prompts are written to stderr. After surrounding whitespace is ignored, only case-insensitive `y` or
`yes` approves an input. Empty, `n`, or `no` responses decline; other text is invalid; and end of
input is interrupted. These outcomes report `confirmation_declined`,
`confirmation_invalid_response`, or `confirmation_interrupted`, respectively, with no unapproved
Trash call. For per-input confirmation, these responses do not change the successful exit code;
batch confirmation refusal remains an operational failure. Invalid per-input responses continue like a
rejection; interrupted input
stops further prompts because no later approval can be read. `--non-interactive`, a non-TTY stdin,
or an unavailable prompt capability reports `confirmation_required` without reading input or
blocking.

All paths are planned before confirmation. Approved ordinary entries are passed to Finder serially
through a structured Apple Event. Symbolic links use Foundation directly, never as a Finder failure
fallback, and an owned finalizer preserves Put Back without following the link target. Each success
reports the system-returned exact URL. Failure never triggers permanent deletion,
`NSWorkspace.recycle`, direct Trash-directory access, or overwrite.
By default, an item failure does not prevent later inputs from being processed; `--stop-on-error`
records all later inputs as skipped. A moved result with a Trash Warning is successful and does not
trigger that stop. Missing inputs fail unless `--ignore-missing` is active, in which case their
error output and exit-status effect are suppressed.

One standard-mode success writes exactly one escaped line containing the user-provided source and
the exact Trash receipt destination. A standard-mode batch writes one aggregate summary instead of
per-item success lines. `--verbose` writes every top-level moved or skipped result in input order.
Quiet mode suppresses normal results but never a warning or error. `--json` writes exactly one
schema-version-1 document to stdout for a preview or real operation. The document includes aggregate
success and counts plus one ordered item for every top-level input. Item states are `planned`,
`moved`, `failed`, or `skipped`; each item contains an absolute source, nullable exact destination,
kind, and nullable structured error. Compatibility warnings and operational diagnostics remain on
stderr. JSON exposes only tc's stable error code and human-readable message, never a Foundation
error domain or numeric code. Consumers must depend on the stable code rather than parsing message
text. Absolute paths in JSON may be sensitive; tc does not retain or upload path history.

The first real Trash Operation may show a macOS Automation prompt allowing the invoking terminal or
`tc` to control Finder. Accepted permission is normally reused for that sender-to-Finder pair but
can be revoked, reset, or requested separately by another terminal application. Consent-required,
denied, unavailable-Finder, and timeout outcomes fail closed with stable error codes.

Finder owns the private metadata used by “Put Back.” Finder handles ordinary entries directly but
refuses symbolic links. For links, tc prepares two same-directory finalizers before moving the
target, makes the target the first Foundation Trash call, then uses a successful Foundation
finalizer call to activate Put Back. It does not run a target-before-move Trash preflight because
that call was shown to consume the metadata transition needed by the target.
Normal completion is silent and leaves no helper behind. `symlink_put_back_not_guaranteed` or
`finalizer_cleanup_failed` reports a moved result with its exact destination on stderr without
changing the successful exit code.
If a failed finalizer call no longer has its exact source identity, tc stops without using the
backup and reports `finalizer_state_uncertain`, preserving the best available Put Back state.
If the user link has not moved but a prepared finalizer cannot be identity-verified and removed, the
operation instead fails with `finalizer_cleanup_failed`; its `not_moved` or `state_uncertain`
classification comes from the normal post-call source-identity check.

Native options set confirmation (`-f`, `-i`, `-I`, `--confirm`), missing-path
(`--ignore-missing`), output (`-v`, `--quiet`, `--json`), preview (`--dry-run`), automation
(`--non-interactive`), batch (`--stop-on-error`), and compatibility-validation
(`--strict-options`) policy independently. Arguments are parsed once from left to right, including
characters within combined short options. `--json` conflicts with `--quiet`; `--verbose` does not
change or expand the JSON schema.

Compatibility Options `-r`, `-R`, `-d`, and `-x` are accepted with no effect. `-P` is accepted with
a stderr warning that secure overwrite is not performed. That warning is independent of TTY state,
`--non-interactive`, `--quiet`, and redirection, and does not change an otherwise successful exit
code. `-W` is unsupported. `--strict-options` rejects every no-effect Compatibility Option,
including `-P`, before filesystem inspection, confirmation, or Trash capability construction.

`tc --help` prints concise native help, while `tc --help -a` groups compatibility behavior into
accepted-with-no-effect, accepted-with-warning, and unsupported sections. `-zh` selects Chinese for
either help surface. `tc --version` prints `tc 0.1.0-beta.1`. These information commands require no Trash
Input, do not construct the platform filesystem adapter, and do not inspect filesystem or Trash
capabilities.

Required missing paths, operational failures, and Protected Path refusals return exit code 1. A
short `-f` that remains effective with no paths is a successful empty operation; other empty
invocations are usage errors. Usage errors and unsupported options return exit code 64 without
presenting a plan. In JSON mode, the successful empty operation is represented by a complete empty
schema-version-1 document. Protected Paths include filesystem
root, the current working directory, the user's home directory, their identity-equivalent path
expressions, and explicit parent-directory expressions such as `..`. Effective root execution also
returns exit code 1 before planning or Trash capability construction. `-f`, `--confirm=never`, and
`--non-interactive` cannot bypass root or Protected Path policy. A failed system Trash call reports a
stable code plus `not_moved` when the original identity remains, or `state_uncertain` when the final
state cannot be established reliably.
